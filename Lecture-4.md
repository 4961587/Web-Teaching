## Introduction to node.js

Node.js in its own words:

```
â€œNode.js is a platform built on Google Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, 
scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking  I/O model that 
makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that 
run across distributed devices."
```

The most important keywords in this description are `scalable`, `event-driven` and `non-blocking`. While we are not concerned with scalability in this course, we will return to the other two keywords shortly.

Node.js is by now a well-established platform; the most important milestones between 2008 and 2018 are:

- Google's JavaScript execution engine (**V8**) was open-sourced in 2008 (if you are interested what happened in the 10 years since then, [check out this blog post from the V8 team](https://v8project.blogspot.com/2018/09/10-years.html)).
- node.js builds on V8 and was released in **2009**.
- node.js' package manager (npm) was released in **2011**.
- December 2014: node.js developers were unhappy with the stewardship of the project and forked io.js.
- May 2015: io.js merged back with node.js. The [Node.js Foundation](https://foundation.nodejs.org/) was set up and is steering node's development to this day.
- 2017: node becomes a **first-class citizen of V8**, i.e. no V8 commit (code changes) is allowed to break node.

Node.js is widely used today, in [Stack Overflow's 2017 developer survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2017) Node.js was the most popular framework in the *Frameworks, Libraries, and Other Technologies* section.

If you want to know more about how the V8 engine and node.js fit together, check out [this keynote by Franziska Hinkelmann](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsDqH_RKvyc), a Googler who works on the V8 engine.

### Event-driven and non-blocking

One of the core concepts of the node.js platform is the **event loop**. Node.js is a single-threaded application that executes **callbacks** in response to an occurring event. Developers write those callbacks. The event loop waits for events to enter the **event queue** and once they have, the events are processed in their order of arrival, i.e. their respective callbacks are executed. 

Take a look at this event loop example:

![Node.js event loop](img/L4-event-loop.png)

Here, despite the **single-threaded nature** of node.js, several things are seemingly going on in parallel: a file is read from disk, a database is queried while at the same time an http request from a client comes in. The reason for this is the **asynchronous** nature of file reads, network requests and so on (basically: I/O requests). To make this concrete, let's look at how local files are read in node. Here is an example taken from the [documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_readfile_path_options_callback) (*note, that the documentation it does not actually say `function(err, data)` but `(err, data) =>` instead; this is just a syntactic shortcut called an [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions) introduced in ES6*):

```javascript
fs.readFile('/etc/passwd', function(err, data) {
    if(err) throw err;
    console.log(data);
})
```

The method `readFile` takes two arguments: the path of the file to read and a **callback function**: the function to execute when the file reading operation has completed. The callback function has to arguments: an error object and a data object. If the file reading operation failed for some reason, we throw the error in this case, otherwise we print out the data to the console. Once the node runtime encounters this code snippet, it will execute `fs.readFile(....)` and return immediately to execute the next line of code (this is called **non-blocking**). What happens to the file read operation? The node runtime has access to a pool of I/O threads and once a thread has completed the file reading operation, an event is entered into the event loop to then execute the callback (in our case printing out the contents to the console). So, more accurately we should say that node.js has a **single-threaded event loop** nature. 

The node runtime can also read file contents from disk in a **blocking** manner:

```javascript
let data = fs.readFileSync('/etc/password');
```

Here, the node runtime will wait until the file read is complete, return the file content in the `data` variable and then continue with the next line of code. If this file is large, this operation will take time and nothing else is executed in the meantime (because the code is **blocking**). 

One more example of the block vs. non-blocking nature:

| Blocking I/O (database)                                      | Non-blocking                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. read request                                              | 1. read request                                                     |
| 2. process request and access the database             | 2. process request and make a **callback** to access the database |
| 3. **wait** for the database to return data and process it | 3. **do other things**                                                  |
| 4. process the next request                               | 4. when the callback returns process it                          |


What this example showcases is node's very efficient way of handling I/O requests. I/O requests usually require a waiting time - waiting for a database to return results, waiting for a third-party Web service or waiting for a connection request. By using callbacks, the node runtime does not wait around for slow I/O operations to finish. This explanation is by necessity a simplified version of the real process, as one could spend a lecture alone on the inner workings of the event loop. If you are interested in this topic, check out the excellent talk by [Philip Roberts on the topic as well as his visualisation tool](http://latentflip.com/loupe/) .

Node's focus on making so-called **I/O bound programs** (i.e. programs constrained by data access where adding more CPU power will not lead to speedups) efficient comes at a price: programs that require heavy CPU usage and contain few I/O requests may be better served on other platforms. As the typical Web application is I/O bound, node.js has become a popular choice of server-side framework. Another positive side effect of node is the "reuse" of the language: instead of learning JavaScript for the client-side and PHP (or another language) for the server-side, we restrict ourselves to a single language and can even share code between client and server efficiently.

## Node.js in examples

Let's now walk through a number of node.js code examples that increase in complexity and lead us towards server-side scripting for Web applications. Along the way, we introduce important node runtime concepts.

### Watching a file for changes

Here is a very simple task: write a script or program that "watches" a given file for changes and "alerts" us to any changes by printing out a message on the console. You should know how to do this in Java already.

Let's look at how we can solve this task in node.js. *Note here, that the task has nothing to do with Web applications!* The [node script](demo-code/node-file-watching-ex) looks as follows:

```javascript
var fs = require('fs');

var file = process.argv[2];

fs.watch(file, function () {
	console.log("File changed!");
});

console.log("Now watching " + file);
```

That's all. Store this code in a file of your choosing, e.g. `watching.js`, open the terminal and then start the script execution with `node watching.js /path/to/file/to/watch`. The command line argument here is the path to the file to watch, if it is a file in the same directory as your script, you simply add the filename. Depending on the operating system, when you make a change to the watched file (e.g. add a line of text) this may or may not require saving the file before your node script reports a file change. This code also assumes that the file to watch actually exists, we do not check for this.,

Although the piece of code is small, it has a few interesting components:
- Line 1 provides us with access to the filesystem object. The corresponding **node module** is `fs`. A module is a **self-contained** piece of code that provides reusable functionality. The function `require()` usually returns a JavaScript object that in this case is our entry point to the file system. 
- You should have recognized that [`fs.watch`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#fs_fs_watch_filename_options_listener) contains two arguments: the path to the file to watch and a **callback** function that is executed when a file change has occurred. The callback function is anonymous and executed asynchronously.
- As the filesystem access requires operating system specific code, the behaviour can vary across file systems; the underlying operating system calls are outlined in the [`fs.watch`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/fs.html#fs_fs_watch_filename_options_listener) documentation (scroll to *Availability*).
- Having started the script you will have noticed that the last line of code (*Now watching ...*) is executed immediately after the **setup** of the callback.

A final note on node terminology. You will often find references to **node modules** and **node packages**. They differ slightly in meaning:
- A **module** is any file or directory that can be loaded by `require()`.
- A **package** is any file or directory that is described by a `package.json` file.

Although not very useful, our `watching.js` script above can be considered a module, but not a package, as so far we have not seen the need for a `package.json` file (this will come later).

### Lowl-level networking with node.js

Node.js was designed for I/O bound programs, in particular programs requiring **networking** functionalities. For this reason, node.js has built-in support for **low-level** socket connections (TCP sockets in particular). Sockets are defined by IP address and port number.

TCP socket connections have **two endpoints**:
1. **binds** to a numbered port;
2. **connects** to a part.

An analogous example of TCP socket connections are phone lines: One phone *binds* to a phone number. Another phone tries to call that phone. If the call is answered, a connection is established.

Let's now move our file watching example into the networked world. The new task is to inform "interested" clients about changes to the watched file. Here is a visual depiction of the process:

![low-level networking visual](img/L4-tcp-js.png)

This is our corresponding [script](demo-code/node-tcp-ex):

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const net = require('net');

//command line arguments: file to watch and port number
const filename = process.argv[2];
const port = process.argv[3];

var server = net.createServer(function (connection) {

    //what to do on connect
    console.log("Subscriber connected");
    connection.write("Now watching " + filename +
        " for changes\n");

    var watcher = fs.watch(filename, function () {
        connection.write("File " + filename +
            " has changed: " + Date.now() + "\n");
    });

    //what to do on disconnect
    connection.on('close', function () {
        console.log("Subscriber disconnected");
        watcher.close();
    });
});

server.listen(port, function () {
    console.log("Listening to subscribers...");
});
```

To start this script (let's assume it is saved as `tcp.js`), we now require two command line arguments: the file to watch and the port number we want the `server` object to listen to:

```
node tcp.js todos.txt 3001
```

Any port number between 1023 and 65536 is a good one (ports 1 to 1023 are *system ports*), as long as no other program has already bound to it. If you try to use the same port as another program, node will throw an `EADDRINUSE` error. A very typical port number you find in code examples is `3000` or `3001`, though once more, the concrete port number chosen does not matter. 

Ok, we just started the server, that is waiting for clients/subscribers on port `3001`. The next obvious question is on how to start up clients. For this exercise, we will use telnet (you should already be familiar with it). Head to the terminal and type:

```
telnet localhost 3001
```

`localhost` is the hostname, you can also replace it by `127.0.0.1`, which is typically assigned to `localhost`. It basically means *this computer*, as we start our server in the same machine as our client.

When you make changes to the watched file, you will find that those are now reported to our telnet client. You can close the telnet session by first pressing <Ctrl> + `]` (which brings you to the telnet prompt) and then type `quit` followed by <Enter>.

Let's take a closer look at the source code:
- We here make use of the [`net` module](https://nodejs.org/api/net.html) which provides an asynchronous network API. It is one of the core modules and comes prepackaged in node - we will later see how to install non-core modules. 
- The method `net.createServer` returns a server object and takes as argument a callback function, which is invoked when another endpoint connects.
- With `server.listen(port)` we **bind** our server to a specific port.
- The callback function contains both client-side and server-side output. All client-side output is "written" to the connection object (which takes care of all the low-level details of actually sending the data), while as we already know the server-side messages are simply written out to our `console` object:

![tcp example](img/L4-tcp-js-2.png)

### Creating a Hello World! Web server with node.js

By now you will have realized, **node.js is not a Web server**. Node.js provides the **functionality** to implement one! 

Let's do that. We start off with another minimal task: whenever our server receives an HTTP request, it should reply with a "Hello World!" in the HTTP response. Simple enough. Here is the [script](demo-code/node-web-ex) that does exactly that:

```javascript
var http = require("http");

var port = process.argv[2];

var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
    res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
    res.end("Hello World!");
    console.log("HTTP response sent");
})

server.listen(port, function () {
    console.log("Listening on port " + port);
});
```

Let's assume that script is stored in `web.js`, then we can start it as before with `node web.js 3000`. Now that we are moving up in the network stack and work with HTTP, we can use the browser as our client. Open your browser and use the following URL in the browser's address bar: `localhost:3000`, or `localhost:3000/hallo` or any other path. The port number in the URL should match the port your server binds to. Each time, you should see a *Hello World!* in the browser.

A few remarks on the code piece above:
- We here utilize's node's core [http module](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html) which provides us with all necessary functionalities related to http.
- We create a **Web server** with the call `http.createServer`.
- The **callback** function we define has two arguments: an **HTTP request object** and an **HTTP response object**. The callback is executed when an HTTP request comes in.
- Within the callback function we create an HTTP response (making use of the response object, which provides us with the necessary methods such as `writeHead` to write http header information in JSON format) and sending it with the call to `res.end`.

To make the code more modular, we can apply some refactoring, which shows off the function-as-parameter paradigm once more:

```javascript
var http = require("http");

var port = process.argv[2];

function simpleHTTPResponder(req, res){
    res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
    res.end("Hello World!");
    console.log("HTTP response sent");	
}

var server = http.createServer(simpleHTTPResponder);

server.listen(port, function () {
    console.log("Listening on port " + port);
});
```

To make this example a bit more interesting, let's return differnt responses depending on the URL path. The task is now to return a greeting for the `/greetme` path and a 404 Not Found error otherwise. If the URL query (i.e. the part of the URL that assigns values to parameters) contains a parameter named `name`, we greet by name, and otherwise use `Anonymous`. Our [script](demo-code/node-url-routing-ex) now looks as follows:

```javascript
var http = require("http");
var url = require("url");

var port = process.argv[2];

function simpleHTTPResponder(req, res) {

    //parse the URL
    var uParts = url.parse(req.url, true);
    
    //implemented path
    if( uParts.pathname == "/greetme"){
        res.writeHead(200, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });

        //parse the query
        var query = uParts.query;
        var name = "Anonymous";

        if( query["name" != undefined]){
            name = query["name"];
        }

        res.end(" Greetings "+name);
    }
    //all other paths
    else {
        res.writeHead(404, { "Content-Type": "text/plain" });
        res.end("Only /greetme is implemented.");
    }
}

var server = http.createServer(simpleHTTPResponder);

server.listen(port, function () {
    console.log("Listening on port " + port);
});
```

The code showcases how to make use of another core node module, the [url module](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/url.html); it provides support for URL resolution and parsing.

Start the server (by now you know how) and try different URLs in the browser (adapt the port number if necessary):
- `localhost:3000`
- `localhsot:3000/greetme`
- `localhost:3000/greetme?name=Claudia`
- `localhost:3000/hello`
- `localhost:3001`

By this time you may ask yourself how tedious server-side programming really considering that we now implemented a separate logic for each URL route. Clearly, there must be more to node.js then the few modules we introduced so far. And indeed there is. Note though that this exercise in low-level node.js capabilities were not in vain, there are many network programming use cases that do not require a Web server.

When we do though, in the node.js community that typically means making use of [Express](https://expressjs.com/).

## Express

As noted in the course book (Chapter 6), Express *creates a layer on top of the core http module that handles a lot of complex things that we don't want to handle ourselves, like serving up static HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript files.* Express is a rather minimalistic Web framework that provides a "*thin layer of fundamental Web application features, without obscuring Node.js features that you know and love*" ([Express](https://expressjs.com/) in its own words).

Node.js has a small core code base; it comes with a number of core modules included such as http and url. Express is not one of the core modules (though it is certainly among the most popular non-core modules with more than [3 million downloads per week](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)) and needs to be installed separately. In the node ecosystem, the node package manager ([NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)) provides us with an easy to use and efficient manner to install additional packages. 

Let's say you want to know whether a node module exists that offers functionality you do not want to implement yourself. For this example, let this be the functionality of finding the smallest number in a list:
1. Head to [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/), which allows you to search and browse more than 650,000 existing node packages. You can also publish your own. Having such a central repository of packages helps code discovery and reuse.
2. Search for the desired functionality, e.g. by using *smallest in list* as query.
3. If you used my query above, your search result list will most likely contain a single package: [smallest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/smallest).
4. The package description provides you with information on **how to install** the package and how to use it, as well as how popular the package is.

Once we have discovered the node packages we need for our project, how do we go about installing them? First of all, in order to create a project, create a folder, e.g. `node-express-ex`. `cd` into the folder (which is still empty) and execute the following command:

```
npm init -y
```

This will create a `package.json` file in the folder which contains basic information about the project, all filled with defaults. If you do not want the defaults, run `npm init` instead, the `-y` option ensures that you are not asked any questions. Let's assume you want to install the Express package. Run the following command:

```
npm install express --save
```

This will install Express in the folder `node_modules` (which is automatically created within your current folder; as Express depends on many other packages, you will find more than just Express in there). The `--save` option ensures that the `package.json` file is altered, it now contains the entry:

```javascript
"dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.16.3"
}
```

This means, that the project is dependent on Express. Without the `--save` option, the installation of Express would have occurred as well, however, the `package.json` file would remain unaltered (the dependencies are not saved). When `package.json` is properly maintained, the application can be installed by anyone with `npm install`, as also seen in the [demo game application](https://github.com/chauff/Web-Teaching/tree/master/demo-code).

### Greetings Express!

Let's look at how to implement our greetings example with Express:

```javascript
var express = require("express");
var url = require("url");
var http = require("http");

var port = process.argv[2];
var app = express();
http.createServer(app).listen(port);

var htmlPrefix = "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head></head><body><h1>";
var htmlSuffix = "</h1></body></html>";

app.get("/greetme", function(req, res){
    var query = url.parse(req.url, true).query;

    var name = ( query["name"]!=undefined) ? query["name"] : "Anonymous";

    res.send(htmlPrefix+"Greetings "+name+htmlSuffix);
})

app.get("/goodbye", function(req, res){
    res.send(htmlPrefix + "Goodbye to you too!" + htmlSuffix);
})

app.get("/*", function(req, res){
    res.send("Not a valid route ...");
})
```

Start the server and try a few URLs yourself!

A few remarks:
- The call `express()` returns an object (usually named `app` for application) that is our way of using Express.
- We here define three so-called **URL routes**: `/greetme`, `/goodbye` and `/*`, with the latter representing all possible routes. When an HTTP request comes in, the Express framework determines which route to execute - the routes are evaluated in order of appearance and the way we set up the code, it is only possible for a single route to be activated per request (we will see later how to change this). Since `/greetme` appears before `/*` in our list of routes, we see the intended greeting. If we woudl move the `/*` route to be the first in the file, the only response we would ever see, no matter the URL path, would be *Not a valid route ...*.
- Lastly, it is no longer necessary to create HTTP headers. Express takes over this tedious task, all we have to do is call the `send()` method of the HTTP response object.

As before, this code is not maintainable, writing HTML code within a node.js script is poor form, not maintainable and error-prone. For **static files**, i.e. files that are *not* created or changed on the fly, e.g. CSS, client-side JavaScript, HTML, images and audio files, Express offers us a very simple solution:

A single line of code is sufficient to serve static files:

```javascript
app.use(express.static(__dirname + "/static"));
```

For this code snippet to work, all static files need to be contained in the directory `static`; [`__dirname`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/globals.html) is a globally available string that contains the directory name of the current module. In response to an HTTP request, Express first checks the static files for a given route - if a static file is found, this is served, otherwise the **dynamic routes** are checked until a fitting route is found.

### A complete Web application

Having all the pieces in place (knowledge of HTML, client-side JavaScript, node.js scripting), we can now write a complete Web application. A good development strategy is the following:

1. Develop the client-side code (HTML, JavaScript and CSS - the latter we will cover in one of the next lectures);
2. Place all client-side files into a directory (e.g. `/client` or `/static`) **on the server**;
3. Write the **server code** using Express;
4. Set Express' static file path to the directory created in step (2);
5. Add interactivity between client and server.

Here is an example of a concrete folder structure for a todo application:

![folder structure](img/L4-file-structure.png)

In [Assignment 2](Assignment-2.md) you will learn how to create such a folder structure semi-automatically, according to accepted best practices.

Step (5), the interactivity between client and server is the most time-consumgin part of the application development, as can be based on different technologies, depending on the application's needs. In the course book, this interactivity is solved with **Ajax** (which is sensible in the context of the Todo application developed throughout the book), while in the game project we ask you to solve the interactive part with WebSockets (which is sensible due to the bidirectional communication needs). 

Here is a typical Web application flow that showcases a possible client-server interaction for a Todo application:

![Todo application](img/L4-todo-app.png)

When designing your own application, it is vital to have a good understanding of the request/response flow in different stages of the application.

## JSON: exchanging data between the client and server

JSON stands for *JavaScript Object Notation* and is a format that transmits data in human-readable text. It consists of attribute value pairs and array data types. Here is an example of a Twitter message in JSON format (taken from [Twitter's documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/data-dictionary/overview/intro-to-tweet-json.html):

```javascript
{
  "created_at": "Thu Apr 06 15:24:15 +0000 2017",
  "id_str": "850006245121695744",
  "text": "1\/ Today we\u2019re sharing our vision for the future of the Twitter API platform!\nhttps:\/\/t.co\/XweGngmxlP",
  "user": {
    "id": 2244994945,
    "name": "Twitter Dev",
    "screen_name": "TwitterDev",
    "location": "Internet",
    "url": "https:\/\/dev.twitter.com\/",
    "description": "Your official source for Twitter Platform news, updates & events. Need technical help? Visit https:\/\/twittercommunity.com\/ \u2328\ufe0f #TapIntoTwitter"
  },
  "place": {   
  },
  "entities": {
    "hashtags": [      
    ],
    "urls": [
      {
        "url": "https:\/\/t.co\/XweGngmxlP",
        "unwound": {
          "url": "https:\/\/cards.twitter.com\/cards\/18ce53wgo4h\/3xo1c",
          "title": "Building the Future of the Twitter API Platform"
        }
      }
    ],
    "user_mentions": [     
    ]
  }
}
```

In early (earlier) years of the Web, XML was used as data exchange format. XML is well defined but not easy to handle. To get an idea of XML, take a look at [this Twitter output in XMl format](https://gist.github.com/jonm/3080489).

JSON was developed by Douglas Crockford, one of the early advocates for JavaScript and the authors of the [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596517748.do). XML is often too bulky in practice; JSON has a much smaller footprint than XML. Importantly, JSON can be parsed with built-in JavaScript functionality ([`JSON.parse`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse)), which turns a JSON string into an object. Similarly, JavaScript objects can be turned into JSON with the [`JSON.stringify`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) method.

Two major differences between JSON and JavaScript objects are:
- In JSON, all property names must be enclosed in quotes.
- JSON objects **do not have functions** as properties. If an object contains functions as properties, a call to `JSON.stringify` will strip them out. 

With JSON being a de facto data exchange standard, Express has a dedicated response object method to send a JSON response: [`res.json(param)`](http://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.json). The method's parameter is converted to a JSON string using `JSON.stringify()`. You will see a working example of this method in the next section.

## Ajax: dynamic updating on the client

Ajax stands for **Asynchronous JavaScript and XML**, although XML is only in the name (we tend to use JSON for data exchanges today or some other self-designed format). Ajax is a **JavaScript mechanism** that enables the dynamic loading of content **without having to refetch/reload the page manually**. Ajax is a technology that **injects** new data into an existing Web page. Ajax is not a language, it is not a proeduct. You see examples of this technology every day; if you stay long enough on the Twitter homepage, you will see a message such as *See 2 new tweets*, which appeared without a complete reload of the page. If we keep the browser's Web dev tools open (in particular the [Network Monitor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Network_Monitor)), we now see a continous stream of request/response message pairs - every few seconds the browser sends a request to Twitter's servers to check for new tweets to load:

![Twitter xhr](img/L4-xhr.png)

 The column *Cause* lists the reason for the network request - `xhr`, which tells us that Ajax was used. `xhr` is short for `XMLHttpRequest`, which is an object offered by all major browsers that is the heart of Ajax and allows you to:
- make requests to the server without a full page reload;
- receive data from the server.

The `jQuery` library hides a lot of the low-level `XMLHttpRequest` details. A working toy example can be found [here](demo-code/node-ajax-ex). In this example code, you will note that the server-side code does not do anything special because Ajax is involved; to the server, the requests look like any other HTTP request. This leaves us to look at the client-side. Here, we first consider `index.html`:

```html
<!doctype html>
<head>
	<title>Plain text TODOs</title>
	<script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
	<script src="js/client-app.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</head>

<body>
	<main>
		<section id="todo-section">
			<p>My list of TODOS:</p>
			<ul id="todo-list">
			</ul>
		</section>
	</main>
</body>
</html>
```

We first load the jQuery library and then the client-side JavaScript source. Note here, that the TODO list is empty. We have an empty unordered list element (`<ul>`) that will be filled with TODOs via Ajax calls. Let's find out how to make Ajax requests with the help of jQuery by looking at `js/client-app.js`:

```javascript
var main = function () {
	"use strict";

	var addTodosToList = function (todos) {
		console.log("Loading todos from server");
		var todolist = document.getElementById("todo-list");
		for (var key in todos) {
			var li = document.createElement("li");
			li.innerHTML = "TODO: " + todos[key].message;
			todolist.appendChild(li);
		}
	};

	/*
	 * This request retrieves the todo list once, to make this a regular
	 * "event", make use of setInterval() 
	 */ 
	$.getJSON("../todos", addTodosToList)
		.done( function(){ console.log("Ajax request successful.");})
		.fail( function(){ console.log("Ajax request failed.");});
};
$(document).ready(main);
```

Let's start at the bottom of this code snippet. In order to retrieve the list of TODOs from the server, we use `$.getJSON(url, function(data))`. This is jQuery's shorthand for making an HTTP GET request to `url` and executing the function specified as second parameter in the case of a successful request. When the request is successful, `data` will contain the data retrieved from the server. What do we do with that data then? To answer this question, we need to parse our function expression `addTodosToList`: we first locate in the DOM tree the unordered list placeholder which we gave the id `todo-list`; for every todo we received, we create a list element (`<li>`) with the corresponding text and append it to our `<ul>` element.

Without the use of jQuery, the `XMLHttpRequest` object leads to more clunky looking code, as this [MDN example](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/AJAX/Getting_Started) shows.

In a nutshell, Ajax works as follows:
1. The Web browser creates a `XMLHttpRequest` object.
2. The `XMLHttpRequest` object requests data from a Web server.
3. The data is sent back from the server.
4. On the client, JavaScript code injects the data into the page.

Or graphically:

![Ajax in a picture](img/L4-ajax.png)

Importantly, with Ajax, the number of complete page reloads is vastly reduced. Only the newly available or changed data needs to be retrieved from the server, instead of the complete Web page.

In practice, implementing Ajax calls correctly can be frustrating, mostly due to Ajax's security model. In our example, we have conveniently requested data from "our" Web server. In fact, a security restriction of Ajax is that it can only fetch files or request routes from the same Web server as the calling page (so-called *Same-origin policy*). The same origin policy is fulfilled when the protocol, port and host are the same for two pages. Important for debugging: Ajax **cannot** be executed from a Web page opened locally from disk (e.g. if you head to your browser and open `file:///Users/claudia/GitHub/Web-Teaching/demo-code/node-ajax-ex/client/index.html`).

Note, that there are ways around Ajax' same-origin policy, some of which have been collected in this rather old [stackoverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3076414/ways-to-circumvent-the-same-origin-policy). As in all scenarios and usages of Web technologies, the interaction between technologies and the availability of all kinds of Web technologies makes it possible to "misuse" a technology for another purpose to circumvent a perceived restriction or shortcoming. So, despite there being possibilities to enable Ajax across origins, it is not recommended and using Ajax as-is does not allow it.

## WebSockets

While Ajax is a mainstay of today's Web, it has a major limitation: the server cannot *push* data to the client, it can only respond to HTTP requests, thus requiring a form of *polling* to simulate the desired push-based behaviour. This results in a number of issues:
- Every time data is sent, an HTTP response is required - this has a considerable amount of overhead if the data to send is only a few bytes.
- The client 


   o  The wire protocol has a high overhead, with each client-to-server
      message having an HTTP header.

   o  The client-side script is forced to maintain a mapping from the
      outgoing connections to the incoming connection to track replies.



The WebSocket protocol (defined in [RFC 6455](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455)) was designed to fill this gap. Quoting the RFC abstract:

```quote
The WebSocket Protocol enables two-way communication between a client
[...] to a remote host [...]. The protocol consists of an opening handshake
followed by basic message framing, layered over TCP.  The goal of
this technology is to provide a mechanism for browser-based
applications that need two-way communication with servers that does
not rely on opening multiple HTTP connections (e.g., using
XMLHttpRequest or <iframe>s and long polling).
```

In other words, the WebSocket protocol enables **bidirectional** communication between client and server over HTTP. Once a connection between a client and server is opened, messages can be send back and forth. This is especially vital for Web applications that require constant bidirectional communication such as instant messaging (a client sends its own messages to the server, the server pushes messages of the client's chat partners)and gaming applications (a client/player sends his own move to the server, the server pushes the other players' moves to the client).





















## Self-check

Here are a few questions you should be able to answer after having followed the lecture and having worked through the required readings:

1. Does `require()` use synchronous or asynchronous access?
2. Executing this node.js code yields which console output?
```javascript
var fs = require('fs');
var n = -1;

function f(){
    //asynchronous
    fs.readFile('n.txt', function(err, content){
        n = parseInt(content); //n.txt contains 42
        n++;
    });
}
f();
console.log(n);
```
3. Executing this node.js code yields which console output?
```javascript
var fs = require('fs');

function f(done){
    fs.readFile('n.txt', function(err, content){
        var n = parseInt(content); //n.txt contains 42
        n++;
        done(n);
    })
}

f(function(n)){
    console.log(n);
}
```
4. How does an Ajax request appear to a Web server?
    - An Ajax request looks like any other HTTP request.
    - An Ajax request is not sent via HTTP, but instead via atp, the Ajax transfer protocol.
    - An Ajax request always has to be sent as part of an HTML `<form>`.
    - An Ajax request is never sent to a Web server, the reply is generated by the browser cache.
5. Imagine building a chat application using Ajax (under HTTP/1.1). How is the browser notified of new messages to display?
    - Ajax allows the server to push HTTP responses to the client.
    - The browser has to poll the server for message updates in short time intervals.
