# Web and Database Technology (CSE1500)

Materials and resources of the 2018/19 [Web and Database Technology course](http://studiegids.tudelft.nl/a101_displayCourse.do?course_id=48438) at TU Delft are listed here. At the moment, only Web topics are covered.

## Required/recommended tools

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (*VS Code* for short) is the recommended development environment for this course. It is a free and open-source IDE available for all major operating systems. It was originally designed to support node.js programmers (a server-Â­side JavaScript framework we will soon use in this class), but now has extensions for many major programming languages. Best of all, Visual Studio Code itself is written in JavaScript! VS Code offers many extensions (see a guide of how to browse and install them [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-gallery)), we recommend the following:
  - [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint);
  - [JSHint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.jshint);
  - [Bracket Pair Colorizer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CoenraadS.bracket-pair-colorizer);
  - [Quokka.js](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=WallabyJs.quokka-vscode);
  - finally, a good [theme](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/themes) for your IDE to make coding more enjoyable is also not a bad idea; [Dracula](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dracula-theme.theme-dracula) is a popular one.
- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (required)
- Modern Web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, ...)

## Useful online coding platforms

- [Glitch](https://glitch.com/)
- [Codepen](https://codepen.io/#)
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)

## Grading

- Course grade:
  - 40% midterm (covers the 8 Web technology lectures)
  - 40% final exam (covers the 7-8 database technology lectures)
  - 20% assignments
- Requirements: to pass, the overall grade must be **5.8** or higher AND the midterm grade must be at least a **5** AND the final exam grade must be at least a **5** in accordance with TU Delft's exam regulations. The assignments are **not required**, though they count towards the final grade.
- Assignments are done in **pairs of two students** and are graded by student assistants in a binary manner (pass or fail). There are five assignments in total, three cover Web programming topics and two cover database topics.
- There is one option to resit one or more of the Web programmign assignments in the week before Christmas.

## Course topics

- Week 1: (Lecture 1) HTTP and (L2) HTML5
- Week 2: (L3) JavaScript and (L4) node.js
- Week 3: (L5) CSS and (L6) node.js (advanced topics)
- Week 4: (L7) Cookies & sessions and (L8) Web security
- Week 5: DB topics
- Week 6: _no lectures_ this week; midterm on Thursday (*the midterm only covers Web programming topics*)
- Week 7: DB topics
- Week 8: DB topics
- Week 9: DB topics (still to be decided whether that week is lecture-free)

## Assignments

Across the five assignments, a Web application, using the modern Web stack will be built.

- [Assignment 1](Assignment-1.md)
- [Assignment 2](Assignment-2.md)
- [Assignment 3](Assignment-3.md)
- [Assignment 4](Assignment-4.md)
- [Assignment 5](Assignment-5.md)

## Interactive Web technology exercises

Students who do not have a lot of prior knowledge often struggle to get started.
Here is a [list of useful interactive exercises](nodeschool-exercises.md) and how they match up with each lecture. 

## Handing in your code
